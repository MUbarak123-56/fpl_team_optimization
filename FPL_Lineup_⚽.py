            The data collected reflects the top 39 highest rated players so far this season in terms of FPL points accumulated over 23 game weeks. By leveraging D-Wave's LeapHybridSolver,
            you will be able to view what the optimal starting line-up would be based on your desired formation. You can sign up for D-Wave Leap [here](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/) and obtain your solver API token. 
            Once you have obtained it, insert it into the D-Wave Solver API token in the sidebar.
            This line-up also takes budget into account. The budget for each starting line-up is expected to be 70. Hence, you will be constrained to a starting line-up whose total value will not exceed 70.
            70 was selected because anything beyond 70 typically selects more than 11 players.
            The regular FPL budget is 100 which selects the starting 11 players including 4 substitutes.
